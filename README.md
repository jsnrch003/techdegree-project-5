# Techdegree Project 5 -- An Interactive Photo Gallery

In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. 

Team Treehouse provided the mockup, thumbnails and photos with descriptions. 

I structured and styled the page according to provided mockup. I also coded the JavaScript that hides and displays photos in real time depending on whether words typed into the search area are contained within the photo captions.
